### The Problem It Solves

Energy demand continues to rise with urban expansion, creating a pressing need for efficient, sustainable energy management. Traditional energy systems are often ill-equipped to handle peak loads, leading to wastage, high costs, and significant strain on power grids. Our Smart Energy Management System is designed to address these challenges by optimizing energy consumption across various sectors, reducing wastage, and promoting sustainable practices through data-driven insights.

Our solution integrates three key functionalities to make energy management efficient, accessible, and actionable:

1. **Predict Building Energy Loads**  
   Our system allows users to anticipate their buildingâ€™s heating and cooling needs through a user-friendly model. By inputting details like relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and distribution, users receive accurate predictions of heating and cooling loads. This feature enables residents and businesses to better plan for energy needs, facilitating efficient resource allocation and potentially supporting decisions around renewable installations.

2. **Solar Panel Calculator**  
   With a Solar Panel Calculator, users can estimate their daily energy needs based on the appliances they own and their usage patterns. By inputting city, appliance type, quantity, and usage hours, the system calculates the energy required, helping users determine how much solar energy would be necessary to support their household or business. This feature makes planning for solar panel installation straightforward, empowering users to incorporate renewable sources into their energy setup and reduce grid dependency.

3. **AI-Powered Chatbot**  
   Our AI chatbot, Photon AI, offers users instant guidance on energy-saving practices and efficient usage tips. Available at all times, it provides customized recommendations, answers questions on energy management, and suggests eco-friendly options for reducing consumption. Photon AI is a virtual energy advisor, making energy management easy and interactive.

Through these functionalities, our system not only informs but empowers users to make real-time, sustainable energy choices, minimizing wastage, reducing costs, and relieving strain on the grid.
